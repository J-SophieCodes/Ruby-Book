Scenario 1: 
  x = 0
  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x

Scenario 2:
  y = 0
  3.times do
    y += 1
    x = y
  end
  puts x

In Scenario 1, x prints 3 to the screen.
In Scenario 2, running the code would give an error because x is only
defined inside the do/end block. The outer scope therefore has no 
access to the value of x.
